# Numerical Computing Calculator
## 4th semester NC project calculator

This is a complete Numerical Methods calculator

- Sleek UI
- Fast

### Features

- Has implementation of 34 methods
- Option to input matrices aswell as algebraic expressions
- Saves the result in an excel file
- Helpful UI

### Helpful Notes
- Function input type should be expression (remove the '=' sign)
- trignometric functions are written like sin(x), cos(x) or tan(x)
- e to the power x will be written as exp(x)
- power sign are ** so cube of 4 is written as 4**3
- \* sign should be added between variables and its constants
- Example Expression: exp(x)+2**(-x)+2*cos(x)-6
- For ldl, Dolittle, Crout and cholesky input can be in either matrix format or expression format
- [2, 3, -1, 2], 
[4, 4, -1, -1], 
[-2, -3, 4, 1] can be converted to 
2\*x1+3*x2-x3-2
4\*x1+4*x2-x3+1
-2\*x1-3\*x2+4*x3-1
